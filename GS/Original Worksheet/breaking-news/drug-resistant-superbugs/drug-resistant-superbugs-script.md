# Drug-Resistant Superbugs - Script

The WHO warned about an increase in superbugs that drugs cannot kill. One in six of bugs tested by researchers was drug-resistant. Many of the drugs have been saving lives for many years. Cuts and infections could kill us in the future because drugs will not kill the bacteria. The WHO said our lives are "at risk".

The WHO looked at data from 100 countries. Drug resistance is highest in Southeast Asia. There, 1 in 3 infections was resistant. Bugs are becoming drug-resistant faster than we can make new drugs. Drug resistance has increased a lot since 2018. Not enough testing is being done to create better drugs.
