## The Mysteries of English Spelling p77

Today, we will talk about some names of animals and the meat that we eat. Let's take pigs, cows, and sheep, for example. When we mention these animals as meat, their names change. On the farm, a pig is called a pig, but in a sandwich, it is called pork. Likewise, cows turn into beef. Sheep turn into mutton. Why do these animals have different names when they are cooked for a meal? The answer is related to British history. In the 11th century, many people in present-day France came to England. So, many French words became part of the English language. When animals were on the farm, they kept their old English names such as pig, cow, and sheep. But when they were cooked and brought to the table, the English versions of the French words were used, such as pork, beef, and mutton. Today, regardless of origin, modern English speakers use both groups of words.

### Questions

1.  **Which is NOT mentioned in the radio program?**
    1.  Pork.
    2.  Beef.
    3.  Mutton.

2.  **Why does English have two groups of names for animals?**
    1.  Because there were two different names for animals in French.
    2.  Because Old English replaced French in the 11th century.
    3.  Because many French words became part of English.
    4.  Because England was divided into two parts.
