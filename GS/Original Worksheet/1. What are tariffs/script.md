[00:02] If you've been seeing the news, you've probably been hearing this word a lot lately:
[00:07] tariff.
[00:08] To me, the most beautiful word in the dictionary is tariff.
[00:12] And it's my favorite word.
[00:13] But what does it mean?
[00:15] And yeah, tariffs may sound like something in complicated political stories,
[00:19] but they can also affect how much things cost you and your family.
[00:23] Don't worry, I'll break it all down.
[00:25] First, let's talk about what a tariff is.
[00:28] A tariff is a tax or a fee
[00:30] that is paid by the buyer on products coming in from another country.
[00:34] Tariffs can be charged in two different ways.
[00:37] They can be a set dollar amount,
[00:39] or they can be a percentage of how much the product costs.
[00:43] First, let's talk about countries trying to make more money.
[00:46] Let's say there's a product coming into Canada and there's a tariff on it.
[00:50] The Canada Border Services Agency
[00:52] collects the tax on behalf of the Canadian government.
[00:56] In 2017, for example,
[00:58] Canada collected 5.7 billion dollars in tariffs.
[01:02] Another reason a country might charge tariffs
[01:04] is to protect jobs and companies.
[01:07] Here are a couple examples.
[01:09] In August 2024,
[01:11] Canada announced a 100% tariff on electric vehicles from China.
[01:16] The tariff is meant to keep foreign-made electric cars out of Canada,
[01:19] making space for Canada to grow its own electric vehicle industry,
[01:23] and to protect Canadian auto workers.
[01:26] To cover the cost of tariffs,
[01:27] the Chinese companies might decide not to sell to Canada,
[01:31] or raise the price of their cars.
[01:34] After seeing that price difference,
[01:36] Canadians might feel more encouraged to buy Canadian-made cars instead.
[01:40] Tariffs can affect businesses within Canada too.
[01:43] Let's say a tech company realizes that it has to pay tariffs when it buys certain parts from other countries.
[01:49] That would make their tech more expensive to make.
[01:51] So, the company might try to find ways to use parts made in Canada,
[01:56] and that decision could help other Canadian businesses.
[01:59] Lastly, a country might charge tariffs to send a message about their relationship with another country.
[02:05] For example, when Russia invaded Ukraine,
[02:07] parts of the world protested by boycotting Russian products.
[02:11] Canada hiked up the rate of tariffs on virtually all imports from Russia and Belarus.
[02:17] Tariffs may come with some pros, but there are also some cons.
[02:20] As you probably figured from the electric vehicle example I mentioned,
[02:24] companies may make up for the cost of tariffs by raising their prices.
[02:28] And that means certain things will be more expensive for people like you and me.
[02:33] Another downside to tariffs is that it can cause tension between governments.
[02:37] This can lead to trade wars.
[02:38] For example, if a country charges really high tariffs against another country,
[02:43] that country could fight back with high tariffs too, or other penalties.
[02:48] Tariffs won't affect everything you and your family buys.
[02:50] For example, Canada has a bunch of free trade agreements with other countries.
[02:56] That's when both trading partners agree not to charge tariffs.
[02:59] Thank you for learning about tariffs with me.
