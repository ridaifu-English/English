# Food and Body Smell - Script

Food and drink change our body smells. We all have different smells. A professor of health said the smells from our body come from two places. One is the bacteria in our stomach. Bacteria break down food and release gases. These gases can give us bad breath. Food also changes the smell of our skin.

The food that makes the strongest body smells contain sulphur. Broccoli and cabbage contain sulphur. Another food is garlic. This makes our breath smell, and can make our armpits smell nicer. Alcohol, coffee and tea can lead to bad breath and a smelly body. If we want to smell nice, we should eat fruit and drink water.
