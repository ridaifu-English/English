| **1. Useful Expressions** | Unsatisfactory | 1/5 | The script is a dialogue and does not use any of the required expressions for an informative presentation. |

| **3. Grammatical Accuracy** | Good | 4/5 | The grammar is generally correct for conversational English. |

| **Total** | | **11/25** | **Overall:** This is a well-written dialogue, but it does not meet the fundamental requirements of the assignment, which was to create a fact-based, structured, informative script. |

| 1. Correct Use of Useful Expressions | 4/5 | Good use of introductory phrases. Could use more transitional phrases in the body and add a concluding phrase. |
| 2. Clarity and Cohesion | 3/5 | The main ideas are clear, but the organization within the body is a bit confusing. The flow could be improved. |
| 3. Grammatical Accuracy | 3/5 | There are some minor grammatical and punctuation errors that should be reviewed. |
| 4. Structure (Introduction, Body, Conclusion) | 2/5 | The script has a clear introduction but lacks a conclusion and the body's structure is disorganized. |
| 5. Fact-Based vs. Opinion-Based Writing | 3/5 | The script presents its points objectively but could be strengthened by using phrases that cite evidence, even if fictional. |
| **Total** | **15/25** | A good start, but needs work on structure, cohesion, and grammar. The conclusion is missing. |

| 1. Correct Use of Useful Expressions | 5/5 | Excellent use of a wide variety of expressions from all sections of the list. |
| 2. Clarity and Cohesion | 3/5 | The script follows the main structure, but the ideas within each section, especially the 'financial' part, are confusing and disconnected. |

| 4. Structure (Introduction, Body, Conclusion) | 4/5 | The script has a clear introduction, a body that follows the plan, and a conclusion. The body's internal logic could be improved. |
| 5. Fact-Based vs. Opinion-Based Writing | 3/5 | The script presents objective points but lacks citations or evidence-based phrases (e.g., "According to research..."), making claims less authoritative. |
| **Total** | **17/25** | Great use of expressions and clear structure, but major issues with grammar and clarity of ideas need to be addressed. |

| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. Correct Use of Useful Expressions | 3/5 | Good use of expressions for the introduction and conclusion, but none are used to connect ideas in the body. |
| 2. Clarity and Cohesion | 2/5 | The script is a simple list of points with very little flow or connection between them. It feels more like notes than a cohesive text. |
| 3. Grammatical Accuracy | 2/5 | There are several grammatical errors and incomplete sentences that make the script unclear and informal. |
| 4. Structure (Introduction, Body, Conclusion) | 2/5 | While there is a basic intro/body/conclusion structure, the body is extremely underdeveloped and the points are not explained. |
| 5. Fact-Based vs. Opinion-Based Writing | 1/5 | The writing is entirely opinion-based ("I think...", "We want..."). It does not present any facts, evidence, or objective arguments. |
| **Total** | **10/25** | The script is very underdeveloped. It needs significant work on developing ideas with evidence, improving grammar, and creating a cohesive body. |

| Criterion | Level | Score | Comments |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Useful Expressions** | Needs Improvement | 2/5 | Only one introductory phrase was used. The script lacks expressions for the body and conclusion. |
| **2. Clarity and Cohesion** | Needs Improvement | 2/5 | The script feels like three separate parts pasted together with no transitions. Several sentences are unclear or poorly constructed. |
| **3. Grammatical Accuracy** | Needs Improvement | 2/5 | There are multiple grammatical errors, including sentence fragments ("It well-known") and run-on sentences. |
| **4. Structure** | Needs Improvement | 2/5 | There is a weak introduction, a disjointed body, and no conclusion. The overall structure is very poor. |
| **5. Fact-Based vs. Opinion**| Needs Improvement | 2/5 | The script mixes facts (location) with unsupported opinions ("so delicious"). It does not cite sources and reads more like a review. |
| **Total** | | **10/25** | **Overall:** This script attempts to be informative but suffers from a lack of structure, cohesion, and grammatical accuracy. It requires significant revision to meet the assignment criteria. |

### Assessment

| Criterion | Score | Comments |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. Correct Use of Useful Expressions | 3/5 | The script uses introductory and concluding phrases, but the introduction is repetitive and contains grammatical errors. More transitional phrases are needed in the body. |
| 2. Clarity and Cohesion | 3/5 | Each point is clear, but there are no transitions between the different sections (remote learning, microwaves, internet), making the script feel disconnected. |
| 3. Grammatical Accuracy | 3/5 | The body of the text is mostly grammatically correct, but there are several errors in the introduction (e.g., "talk the reform," "discuss about"). |
| 4. Structure (Introduction, Body, Conclusion) | 3/5 | The script has an intro, body, and conclusion, but the introduction is weak and does not outline the points. The body needs better transitions. |
| 5. Fact-Based vs. Opinion-Based Writing | 2/5 | The arguments are based on general reasoning and personal desire ("I want to...") rather than on facts, data, or evidence. |
| **Total** | **14/25** | The script presents clear ideas but needs significant improvement in its introduction, use of evidence, and overall cohesion. |

| Criterion | Score | Comments |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. Correct Use of Useful Expressions | 4/5 | Good use of expressions in the body to show contrast and results. The script is missing a formal concluding phrase. |
| 2. Clarity and Cohesion | 2/5 | The first topic is clear, but the second and third topics are very disorganized. The section on transport jumps between unrelated ideas, and the section on food is just a list of disconnected facts. |
| 3. Grammatical Accuracy | 3/5 | The grammar is mostly understandable, but there are several awkward sentences and minor errors that reduce clarity. |
| 4. Structure (Introduction, Body, Conclusion) | 2/5 | The script has a basic introduction but is missing a proper conclusion. The body's structure is weak, especially in the second and third topics. |
| 5. Fact-Based vs. Opinion-Based Writing | 4/5 | The script is appropriately fact-based and uses statistics. It could be improved by connecting the facts more clearly to build an argument. |
| **Total** | **15/25** | The script has a good fact-based approach and uses some expressions well, but it suffers from poor organization, lack of cohesion, and an absent conclusion. |

### Assessment

| Criterion | Score | Comments |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. Correct Use of Useful Expressions | 4/5 | Good and varied use of expressions for all parts of the script. |
| 2. Clarity and Cohesion | 4/5 | The script is very clear and well-organized. The flow is logical, with only a minor interruption where a solution is mixed into a problem-focused paragraph. |
| 3. Grammatical Accuracy | 4/5 | The grammar is strong with only a few minor errors. The text is easy to read and understand. |
| 4. Structure (Introduction, Body, Conclusion) | 5/5 | Excellent structure. The introduction, body, and conclusion are all clear, well-developed, and serve their purpose perfectly. |
| 5. Fact-Based vs. Opinion-Based Writing | 3/5 | The script presents factual-sounding claims but does not cite sources. It also includes an explicit opinion ("We think..."), which slightly weakens the objective tone. |
| **Total** | **20/25** | A very strong, clear, and well-structured script. To improve, focus on citing sources for data and maintaining a purely objective tone. |

### Assessment

| Criterion | Score | Comments |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. Correct Use of Useful Expressions | 3/5 | The script uses introductory phrases well but lacks transitional words in the body and formal concluding phrases. |
| 2. Clarity and Cohesion | 2/5 | Some sections are clear, but the earthquake section is a list of disconnected facts. The last two paragraphs are repetitive, making the overall script confusing. |
| 3. Grammatical Accuracy | 3/5 | The text is mostly understandable but has some grammatical errors and awkward phrasing. The repetition of "It is said that..." is poor style. |
| 4. Structure (Introduction, Body, Conclusion) | 1/5 | The structure is the biggest weakness. The script seems to have two conclusions, with the final paragraph repeating information from the body, making it very redundant and confusing. |
| 5. Fact-Based vs. Opinion-Based Writing | 4/5 | The script is appropriately fact-based and objective, discussing scientific and demographic topics without personal opinion. |
| **Total** | **13/25** | The script is built on a good, fact-based foundation but is critically flawed by a confusing and repetitive structure, particularly at the end. |
