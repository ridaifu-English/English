**The Goose That Laid Golden Eggs**

Once upon a time, a poor farmer lived in a small cottage with his wife. They worked hard every day but barely had enough money to buy food.

Farmer : ( ① ) We work so hard, but we're still poor. How can we ever become rich?
Wife   : Be patient, dear. If we keep working hard, things will get better someday.
Farmer : I hope you're right, but I'm tired of being poor.

One morning, the farmer went to check on his animals and found something amazing.

Farmer : ( あ ) What's this? My goose laid a golden egg! This can't be real!
Wife   : A golden egg? Let me see! Oh my goodness, it's real gold!
Farmer : We're rich! We can sell this and buy food for months!

| A | The farmer and his wife sold the golden egg and bought plenty of food and new clothes. |

The next morning, they found another golden egg.

Wife   : Another one! The goose laid another golden egg!
Farmer : ( い ) This is incredible! We get one golden egg every day!
Wife   : ( ② ) We should take good care of this goose. It's bringing us great fortune.

| B | Days passed, and every morning the goose laid another golden egg, making the couple richer each day. |

But after a few weeks, the farmer became impatient and greedy.

Farmer : ( う ) One egg a day is too slow! I want to be rich right now!
Wife   : But dear, we're already becoming wealthy. Why not be patient?
Farmer : ( ③ ) I have an idea! If I kill the goose and cut it open, I can get all the
         golden eggs at once! Then we'll be the richest people in the village!
Wife   : That sounds dangerous! What if there are no eggs inside?

| C | Despite his wife's warnings, the greedy farmer killed the goose and cut it open. |

Farmer : What? There's nothing inside! No golden eggs at all!
Wife   : Oh no! What have you done? You've killed our golden goose!
Farmer : I... I thought there would be hundreds of golden eggs inside.
Wife   : Now we have nothing. Your greed has destroyed our good fortune.

The farmer realized his terrible mistake, but it was too late. They returned to their life of poverty.
