In India, people often drink tea with milk and spices. The tea is called chai. How was chai born? In India, there's a long history of producing and drinking milk. When people drink milk, they usually put sugar in it. They also often add spices such as cinnamon and ginger. So in India, milk usually means sweet hot milk or spicy milk. In the 19th century, Great Britain made India their colony and started growing tea leaves there. Gradually, people in India began drinking tea. Because the high quality leaves were taken by Great Britain, they could only get low quality leaves. To make the tea tasty, they added sugar and spices just as when they drank milk. Together with milk, the tea became rich in flavor and taste. In this way, chai was born. Today, Indian chai is known around the world.
