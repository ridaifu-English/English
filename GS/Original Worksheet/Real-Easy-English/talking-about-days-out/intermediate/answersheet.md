## Part 6: After You Read/Listen - Think!

**Suggested Answer:**

This is a natural part of growing up. Teenagers often want independence and prefer spending time with friends rather than family. This is healthy for their development. However, families should still make some effort to spend quality time together, perhaps by finding activities that everyone enjoys or respecting teenagers' need for independence while maintaining regular family time. The benefit of family time is maintaining strong relationships, while the benefit of independence is helping young people develop their own identities. A balance between both is probably best - families can be flexible and find new ways to connect that work for everyone's changing needs.
