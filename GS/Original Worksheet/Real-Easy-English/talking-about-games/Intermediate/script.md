# Talking about Games - Conversation Script

Beth:
Hello and welcome to Real Easy English. In this podcast, we have real conversations in easy English to help you learn. I'm Beth.

Georgie:
And I'm Georgie.

Beth:
So, how is your week going, Georgie?

Georgie:
It's going well. It's only Monday. I'm already quite tired. How about you, Beth?

Beth:
I'm OK. I'm not tired yet, but give me till this afternoon.

Georgie:
So, Beth, what are we talking about today?

Beth:
Today we're going to talk about games. The kind of games we like playing. Maybe games we don't like as much. So, shall we start the conversation?

Georgie:
Yes, let's get started! So, Beth, do you enjoy games?

Beth:
It depends on the kind of games. I think if it's something physical where you're, I don't know, running around a park or being silly, sporty things, those kind of fun games I enjoy. But if it's like **board games** or card games, honestly, I don't really like them. What about you?

Georgie:
I do like games. I also like sporty games. We did that in the park, didn't we? With our team?

Beth:
We did, we did.

Georgie:
Which was really fun, and it's a good bonding experience. But I, unlike you, do like card games. And I enjoy playing them with friends in the pub. I can be quite awkward, so sometimes if I feel like I don't want to talk anymore, I suggest a game, and then we don't have to talk to people anymore.

Beth:
I feel like if it's a card game where you have like a question and it's like, I don't know, you've got five seconds, like, name three modes of transport. Those kind of like talking, fun, laughing games with cards I enjoy. But if it's something to do with the heart and the diamond, no. I just think I'd rather have a conversation and just talk to my friends or whoever, whoever I'm with.

Georgie:
OK, so you don't like slow games. So probably you wouldn't like things like Monopoly, which go on for hours, your whole evening.

Beth:
Honestly, I think I had a bad experience as a child with Monopoly. This game… we went away with all of our neighbours. There were lots of people and we played a game of Monopoly and it lasted about, I don't know, five hours. Probably not that long.

Georgie:
Yeah. No, probably. Monopoly lasts for so long.

Beth:
It’s so long.

Georgie:
But also people get really aggressive and competitive with Monopoly, don't they?

Beth:
Is that because people **cheat?**

Georgie:
Yeah. Well, people can **cheat,** yeah, for sure. But people get, it's like they think the game is their real life and they get so angry and people lose friendships.

Beth:
"That is my house!"

Georgie:
Now, you said **cheat.** What does that mean?

Beth:
Well, **cheat** is to kind of lie or say something that isn't true. For example, you might pretend that you have something and actually you don't. **Cheating** is seen as negative.

Georgie:
Yes. It's like you're not following the rules as well.

Beth:
That's it. Yeah.

Georgie:
Do you like **cheating?**

Beth:
When I was a child, I liked to **cheat.** But no, because now it just feels dishonest. If I, if I win a game, I want to win because I actually was good enough or did well enough to win.

Georgie:
Yes.

Beth:
Are you a **cheat?**

Georgie:
I'm not a **cheat.** Because I think I'm, I'm too much of a what we call a **goody-goody** – someone who likes to follow the rules.

Beth:
So, Georgie, a **quiz** is a type of game, I guess. Do you like quizzes?

Georgie:
Yes. I also like **quizzes.** I used to go quite a lot to something we have a lot in the UK called a pub **quiz** where you go to a pub, there are lots of teams and you answer questions with your team. And I used to really enjoy that because a) you're socialising with your friends in the pub, but I find it really satisfying when you get the questions right. I've actually won a couple of pub **quizzes.**

Beth:
Have you?

Georgie:
Yeah.

Beth:
Well done.

Georgie:
It's really hard sometimes when all of the questions are general knowledge that you don't know anything about. That's really boring. But when you know the questions, it's fun.

Beth:
Let's recap the vocabulary we had during the conversation. We had **board games**. These are games where players usually move pieces around a flat board, like chess.

Georgie:
We had **quiz,** which is a game where you answer questions.

Beth:
**Cheat** means to be dishonest when playing a game, and you can also call a person a cheat if they are dishonest in a game.

Georgie:
We had **goody-goody**, which is someone who likes following rules, like me.

Georgie:
Next week we'll be talking about the city and the countryside. See you then.

Beth:
Bye.
