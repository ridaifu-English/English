Reducing food waste at school benefits both students and the community. For example, when our cafeteria added a share table for unopened items, more than 100 snacks were redistributed each week instead of being thrown away. This helped classmates who forgot lunch and cut trash collection by one bag per day. As a result, we saved money and supported a culture of responsibility on campus.

**8. Write two essays in English.** 【思考・判断・表現(10)】

Example answers (50+ words each):

1) It is often said that people today use too much electricity. I agree. Convenience makes us leave lights and devices on longer than necessary, which raises costs for families and increases carbon emissions. Simple habits—like setting sleep timers, unplugging chargers, and using efficient appliances—reduce bills and protect the environment at the same time.

2) Some farmers grow fruits and vegetables without using chemicals. I think more farmers will do this. Consumer demand for safer, healthier food is rising, and chemical‑free methods can protect soil and water. While costs may be higher at first, premium prices and long‑term soil health make this approach sustainable for both farmers and the environment.
