# **All About SPF! - Video Script**

[0:01] Have you seen SPF on your sunscreen bottles?
[0:05] But you don't know exactly what it means?
[0:07] Let me break it down for you.
[0:09] S-P-F stands for Sun Protection Factor.
[0:14] It measures how well a sunscreen can protect you from the sun.
[0:18] The higher the SPF on your sunscreen bottle, the more protection you'll get from sunburn.
[0:22] Trivia time!
[0:24] What do you think the ideal SPF number is?
[0:27] 15? 30? 50? Or 200?
[0:32] You'll find out at the end of the video.
[0:34] But first, let me tell you what SPF protects you from:
[0:37] ultraviolet rays, or UV rays.
[0:40] They're invisible, but you can still feel them on your skin.
[0:44] There are two types: UVA rays and UVB rays.
[0:49] UVA rays are connected to skin aging.
[0:52] UVB rays cause sunburn.
[0:54] A quick way to remember this is A for aging and B for burning.
[0:59] UVA and UVB rays damage the DNA in your skin cells and can play a role in causing skin cancer.
[1:07] SPF usually refers to how much protection you get from UVB rays.
[1:12] But experts recommend protecting yourself from both types of rays.
[1:16] To do that, look for "broad spectrum" on sunscreen labels,
[1:21] which means it'll help protect from both UVA and UVB rays.
[1:26] Now, how is the SPF number for a bottle of sunscreen decided?
[1:30] In a lab, researchers put sunscreen on a patch of skin.
[1:34] Then, they expose that skin to UV rays.
[1:37] They see how long it takes for the skin to redden,
[1:40] and then they compare it to how long it takes for unprotected skin to redden.
[1:44] After that, they divide two numbers:
[1:46] how long it took for the skin with sunscreen to redden,
[1:49] and how long it took for the unprotected skin to redden.
[1:52] And that's the SPF number.
[1:54] True or false: SPF is related to the amount of time you spend in the sun.
[2:00] False! That's actually a common myth.
[2:04] Some people think that if you use SPF 15, for example,
[2:08] then you can stay in the sun 15 times longer than usual.
[2:12] But that's not true.
[2:14] How much of the sun's energy you're exposed to, and how quickly you burn,
[2:19] actually depends on a lot of things, like your skin type.
[2:23] For example, if you have fair skin, you might burn faster than others.
[2:28] How much sunscreen you use, and if you're using enough to cover your whole body,
[2:32] and how often you reapply it.
[2:34] If you're sweating a lot or in the water, you'll need to reapply more often.
[2:40] Remember the question I asked you at the beginning?
[2:42] What do you think the ideal SPF number is?
[2:45] Well, a dermatologist told me the answer is... (drumroll)
[2:50] 50!
[2:51] That's if you're going to be spending a lot of time playing outside.
[2:54] However, for everyday use, a minimum of SPF 30 is enough.
[2:59] But you have to use your sunscreen properly for it to work.
[3:03] That means following the instructions on the package,
[3:07] like putting on the sunscreen 10 to 15 minutes before you go outside,
[3:11] and reapplying every 90 minutes, or after swimming or sweating.
[3:16] I hope you learned a lot about SPF.
