Aさん Isn't that Mr. B? It's been a while.
We haven't seen each other since the
graduation ceremony. I didn't think I'd meet
you here. Mr. B's appearance hasn't
changed much, so I recognized you right
away. Are you going to work now?

Bさん Mr. A! It's been a long time. You look
young too. Actually, I'm on my way home
now. There was a high temperature danger
alert so I have to go home.

Aさん It's true! I just checked and it says
that it will be 50 degrees by 2pm! Thank you
for letting me know.
I think it's probably best not to go into town.
It was my day off, but...

Bさん If you can't go on land, how about
going to the sea? The underwater city
seems like it would be comfortable because
it doesn't get much sunlight, and I heard
that an amusement park recently opened
there, so I think it would be a good choice.

Aさん I think I'll do that... Thank you for
letting me know.
Apparently the train to the underwater city
comes in an hour. We still have plenty of
time.
How about buying me a cup of coffee right
now
as a thank you for letting me know?

Bさん Haha, that's right, I have some free
time too, so let's talk a bit. Please come with
me, Mr. A, I have a cafe I'd like to
recommend. I'm sure you'll like it. After all,
it's a cafe where the owner is a human,
which is rare these days, and he will make
your coffee for you.
