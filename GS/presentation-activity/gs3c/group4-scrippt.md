Today, we would like to talk about "The Impact of Social Media on Teenagers."
This presentation will focus on negative impacts.
We will cover three main points.

First, it is known that about 80% of Japanese people suffer from insomnia.
Young people use the Internet late at night, from 1 a.m. to 3 a.m.
The main reasons for this are to feel less stress and to get away from their life.
For example, they use it when they want to relax after finishing their
activities during the day or when they want to get away from the worries of reality.
We think it is important to have a regular routine, make the bedroom comfortable, and make exercise a habit.

Second, using SNS may cause eyesight problems.
In fact, the number of children with poor eyesight has been
increasing since the 2000s when people began to use SNS.
Particularly, using social media for long periods without breaks can cause eye damage.

Third, SNS leads to a lack of exercise. Using social media for a
long time increases sitting time and leads to a lack of exercise.
However, it can also encourage exercise through information like training methods and interactions.

In conclusion, social media has a lot of negative effects, but it can
be helpful if we don't overuse it.
We hope this presentation has given you a better understanding of the impact of social media on teenagers.
Thank you for listening.
