"Our Vision for the Future: Life in 2050"

Today, we would like to talk about The global problem 30 years later.
This presentation will focus on Global warming, Nankai Trough Earthquake and low birthrate and aging population.
Have you ever wondered about these?

First of all,let's talk about the problem of global warming thirty years later.
The first is the temperature rise. It is said that the average temperature will rise by 1.5 to 2.5 degree in thirty years.
The second is the issue of agriculture and food production. As the temperature rises, the amount of food harvest decreases. Because of that, the price of food will increase.

Next is about the Nankai Trough earthquake.
It is said that the Nankai Trough will have an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.
It is said to occur within 30 years.
It is said that about 300,000 people will die.
Shikoku's the most dangerous area in Japan.
Hokkaido is the safest area in Japan.

In 30 years, there will be fewer children and more old people. This means fewer workers and more people who need help. It will be hard for the country to pay for healthcare and pensions. Schools may close, and more hospitals will be needed. To fix this, countries may use robots, let more people move in, or change the rules to help everyone.

In 30 years, the Earth will be warmer, and food will be harder to grow. A big earthquake may hit Japan, causing many deaths. There will be fewer young people and more old people. Robots, more workers from other countries, and new rules can help solve these problems.

### Assessment

| Criterion | Score | Comments |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. Correct Use of Useful Expressions | 3/5 | The script uses introductory phrases well but lacks transitional words in the body and formal concluding phrases. |
| 2. Clarity and Cohesion | 2/5 | Some sections are clear, but the earthquake section is a list of disconnected facts. The last two paragraphs are repetitive, making the overall script confusing. |
| 3. Grammatical Accuracy | 3/5 | The text is mostly understandable but has some grammatical errors and awkward phrasing. The repetition of "It is said that..." is poor style. |
| 4. Structure (Introduction, Body, Conclusion) | 1/5 | The structure is the biggest weakness. The script seems to have two conclusions, with the final paragraph repeating information from the body, making it very redundant and confusing. |
| 5. Fact-Based vs. Opinion-Based Writing | 4/5 | The script is appropriately fact-based and objective, discussing scientific and demographic topics without personal opinion. |
| **Total** | **13/25** | The script is built on a good, fact-based foundation but is critically flawed by a confusing and repetitive structure, particularly at the end. |
