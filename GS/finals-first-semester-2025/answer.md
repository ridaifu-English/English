**6) Opinion Writing (Sample Answers)**

*   **1) Are tariffs generally a good or a bad idea?**
    *   Tariffs are generally a bad idea because they increase prices for consumers and can lead to harmful trade disputes between countries. While they might protect some specific domestic jobs in the short term, they often harm the overall economy by reducing competition and efficiency.

*   **2) Is A.I. good or bad for jobs?**
    *   A.I. is a double-edged sword for jobs. It is good because it can automate repetitive and dangerous tasks, increase productivity, and create new job categories that we can't even imagine yet. However, it is also bad because it will likely displace many workers, causing significant unemployment if society does not adapt by focusing on education and retraining programs.
