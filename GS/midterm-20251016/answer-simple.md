### **8) Essay Questions - Write 20+ words in English** **[思考・判断・表現(12)]** 各4点

#### **1) Is A.I. good or bad for jobs?**

**Sample Answer (Good):**
"I think A.I. is both good and bad for jobs. It can help us work more efficiently and create new types of jobs, but it may also replace some workers. We need to learn new skills to adapt to the changing job market." (44 words)

**Sample Answer (Bad):**
"A.I. can be dangerous for many jobs because machines might replace human workers. However, I believe that A.I. will also create new job opportunities in technology fields. People should prepare for these changes by learning computer skills." (41 words)

#### **2) Should supermarkets stop selling fruit and vegetables wrapped in plastic?**

**Sample Answer (Yes):**
"Yes, supermarkets should stop selling fruit and vegetables wrapped in plastic because it creates too much waste and harms the environment. We can use reusable bags to carry loose produce instead. This would help reduce pollution and protect our planet." (42 words)

**Sample Answer (No):**
"No, I don't think supermarkets should completely stop using plastic for produce because plastic packaging helps keep food fresh longer and reduces food waste. However, they could use recyclable or biodegradable materials instead of regular plastic." (38 words)

#### **3) Do you think it's always good to look for the cheapest price?**

**Sample Answer (No):**
"I don't think it's always good to look for the cheapest price. Sometimes cheap products have poor quality and break quickly, so we have to buy them again. It's better to buy good quality products that last longer, even if they cost more." (46 words)

**Sample Answer (Yes, with conditions):**
"Looking for cheap prices can be smart when you shop around and compare options. However, we should also consider the quality and how the product was made. The cheapest option isn't always the best choice if it doesn't meet our needs." (44 words)
