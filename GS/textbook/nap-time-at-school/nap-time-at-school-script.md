Aya: What's wrong with you, Ben? You look sleepy.
Ben: Yes, I am. I couldn't sleep well last night because I took a long nap after lunch.
Aya: That often happened to me before, but I found effective ways of taking a nap recently.
Ben: What are they?
Aya: First, you shouldn't sleep for too long. It's best to take a 10 to 20-minute nap.
Ben: I see. I slept for about 3 hours yesterday. That was too long. Anything else?
Aya: Second, don't make the room dark and don't get into bed. If you do so, you may fall into a deep sleep because your brain will think it is night-time.
Ben: Oh. I slept on the bed with the light off yesterday. That's why I couldn't wake up quickly.
Aya: Taking a nap in a wrong way causes us problems. However, if we take an effective nap, we can be healthy.
