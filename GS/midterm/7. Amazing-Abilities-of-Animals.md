Hi, everyone. In our biology class, Ms. Sato mentioned that animals
have great ①( ). For example, many of you know dogs can
smell far ②( ) than us. Then, I wondered if other animals
have such abilities, so I did some research on birds. They have some
amazing abilities. Let me talk about ③( )( ) found.
Do you know how fast birds can fly? The fastest one is said to be a
falcon, or *hayabusa*. It can fly more than 300 km per hour, especially
when it is trying to catch small animals for food. Also, a swallow, or
*tsubame*, can fly about 200 km per hour when escaping from an
enemy. Because of their speed, their names are used for the
Shinkansen.

As I have explained, dogs and birds have great abilities. Other
animals also have amazing abilities. We humans should respect all
living things on earth.
