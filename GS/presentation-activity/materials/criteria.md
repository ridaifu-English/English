# Writing Assessment Criteria

This document outlines the criteria for assessing the writing assignment. The goal is to evaluate the student's ability to construct a well-structured, fact-based, and grammatically correct piece of writing, while correctly utilizing a set of provided useful expressions.

### 1. Correct Use of Useful Expressions

This criterion assesses whether the student has appropriately and correctly used the expressions from `useful-expressions.md`.

| Level | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Excellent (5 pts)** | The writing correctly uses a wide variety of expressions from all sections (Introduction, Body, Conclusion) of `useful-expressions.md`. The expressions are used naturally and enhance the clarity and flow of the text. |
| **Good (3-4 pts)** | The writing correctly uses a good number of expressions. There might be minor errors in usage, or the variety of expressions could be improved. Some sections of the script might be missing appropriate expressions. |
| **Needs Improvement (2 pts)** | The writing uses very few expressions, or many of them are used incorrectly. The student may not have understood how to integrate them into their writing. |
| **Unsatisfactory (1 pt)** | No useful expressions are used, or they are all used incorrectly. |

### 2. Clarity and Cohesion

This criterion evaluates if each sentence is logical, understandable, and connects well with surrounding sentences.

| Level | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Excellent (5 pts)** | All sentences are clear, concise, and easy to understand. The ideas flow logically from one sentence to the next. The entire piece of writing is cohesive. |
| **Good (3-4 pts)** | Most sentences are clear and make sense. There may be a few awkward phrases or sentences where the meaning is slightly unclear. The connection between some ideas could be stronger. |
| **Needs Improvement (2 pts)** | Several sentences are confusing, poorly constructed, or do not connect logically. The reader may have to re-read parts of the text to understand the meaning. |
| **Unsatisfactory (1 pt)** | The writing is largely incoherent. Sentences are jumbled, and it is difficult to follow the writer's train of thought. |

### 3. Grammatical Accuracy

This criterion assesses the student's command of English grammar, including sentence structure, punctuation, and spelling.

| Level | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Excellent (5 pts)** | The writing is free of grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and punctuation errors. The sentence structure is varied and correct. |
| **Good (3-4 pts)** | There are a few minor grammatical, spelling, or punctuation errors that do not interfere with understanding. |
| **Needs Improvement (2 pts)** | There are frequent errors in grammar, spelling, or punctuation. These errors may sometimes make the text difficult to understand. |
| **Unsatisfactory (1 pt)** | Numerous and repeated errors in grammar, spelling, and punctuation make the text very difficult or impossible to understand. |

### 4. Structure (Introduction, Body, Conclusion)

This criterion evaluates if the assignment follows the standard structure of an informative text.

| Level | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Excellent (5 pts)** | The writing has a clear introduction that presents the topic, a well-developed body that provides details and evidence, and a strong conclusion that summarizes the main points. All parts are well-balanced. |
| **Good (3-4 pts)** | The writing has a recognizable introduction, body, and conclusion, but one of the sections may be underdeveloped. For example, the introduction might be too brief, or the conclusion might be abrupt. |
| **Needs Improvement (2 pts)** | One of the structural components (introduction, body, or conclusion) is missing or very poorly executed. The structure is disorganized. |
| **Unsatisfactory (1 pt)** | There is no clear structure to the writing. It appears as a single block of text without logical progression. |

### 5. Fact-Based vs. Opinion-Based Writing

This criterion assesses the ability to write an objective, fact-based text, rather than a subjective, opinion-based one.

| Level | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Excellent (5 pts)** | The writing is consistently fact-based. Claims are supported by evidence, examples, or data (e.g., `According to research...`, `Statistics show that...`). The tone is objective and informative. |
| **Good (3-4 pts)** | The writing is mostly fact-based, but may contain some sentences that express personal opinion or feeling without support (e.g., "I think...", "I feel..."). The objectivity is slightly compromised. |
| **Needs Improvement (2 pts)** | The writing is a mix of facts and personal opinions, with many unsupported claims. The line between objective information and subjective belief is blurred. |
| **Unsatisfactory (1 pt)** | The writing is predominantly opinion-based. It reads like a personal essay rather than an informative, fact-based script. |
