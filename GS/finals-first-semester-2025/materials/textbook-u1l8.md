John : For our group project in social studies class, we have to decide what we will do to save refugee children. Any ideas, Mei?
Mei : Well, why don't we go to a charity concert next month? The concert is for saving children in refugee camps around the world. Half of the ticket price will be donated to a fund for the children. How ①(about)(you), John?
J : That sounds great. I'm also thinking about raising funds through the school festival. For example, we can display photos that show how children live in refugee camps, and ask for donations. ②(Could)(you) tell me your opinion, Lisa?
Lisa : Well, how about attending a seminar by an NPO? I think we need to learn more about children in refugee camps before displaying photos. The NPO workers will tell us more about refugee children.
J : You're right, Lisa. In the seminar, we can learn more about the refugees' situation.
M: I ③(understand)(your) point. Learning about their reality in detail should be our first step.
