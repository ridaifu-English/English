I think farmer should grow vegetables and fruits without chemicals.
Because I think using chemicals when growing vegetables and fruits is bad effect for people’s health and environment. 
For example, it may cause illness to people and harm to water and nature.
However, the number of farmers use chemicals is increasing.
Therefor, I think farmer shouldn’t use chemicals to theirs.
