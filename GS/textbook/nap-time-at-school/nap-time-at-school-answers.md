#### Part 4: Critical Thinking

**Sample Answer:**

If I were designing a "nap room" at school, I would create a bright, comfortable space with natural lighting. Following Aya's advice, the room would have:
- Comfortable chairs or recliners instead of beds
- Large windows or soft lighting to keep the room bright (not dark)
- A timer or clock visible to help students limit their naps to 10-20 minutes
- Quiet, calming music or nature sounds at low volume
- Plants or natural decorations to create a peaceful atmosphere

This design would help students rest without falling into a deep sleep, making it easier to wake up refreshed and return to their studies.

*Note: Student answers may vary. Look for responses that incorporate Aya's key advice: keeping the room bright and not using beds.*
