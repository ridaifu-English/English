# Greenhouse Gases Explained - Video Script
Level: Intermediate

[0:00] Have you heard the term greenhouse gases?
[0:03] Let's break it down.
[0:04] First, let's talk about greenhouses.
[0:07] You know those glass buildings that are used to grow plants?
[0:11] Those glass walls trap the sun's heat.
[0:14] So plants can stay warm, even in the winter.
[0:17] That's pretty much what greenhouse gases do for Earth.
[0:21] They're actually a natural part
[0:22] of the Earth's atmosphere.
[0:25] Think of greenhouse gases like a blanket.
[0:27] They wrap around our planet,
[0:29] keeping it warm so that we can live on it.
[0:32] But, hear me out.
[0:34] You've heard Goldilocks, right?
[0:36] It can't be too hot or too cold.
[0:39] The conditions have to be just right.
[0:42] Because of human activities in the last century,
[0:45] there are more greenhouse gases being released into the atmosphere,
[0:49] disrupting the balance.
[0:51] And that means more heat is getting trapped near the Earth's surface,
[0:55] causing temperatures to rise.
[0:57] And yes, you guessed it.
[0:59] The unusual increase
[1:00] of the Earth's surface temperature is called
[1:02] global warming.
[1:05] So, what exactly are the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere anyway?
[1:09] Well, let's break down five main types.
[1:13] First, Carbon Dioxide.
[1:15] It's the greenhouse gas with the biggest total impact on climate change.
[1:19] Most of the CO2 in the atmosphere has come from burning fossil fuels,
[1:24] so coal, gas, and oil.
[1:27] And then we have Methane.
[1:29] It's released when fossil fuels are extracted from the Earth,
[1:32] but it's also released by livestock,
[1:35] like cows.
[1:37] Next up is Nitrous Oxide.
[1:39] This gas can be released during industrial activities
[1:42] and from burning fossil fuels or solid waste.
[1:45] Then, we've got Fluorinated gases.
[1:48] There are different kinds,
[1:49] but the ones you might be most familiar with are in your fridge.
[1:52] It's used to keep things cool.
[1:55] And finally, water vapor.
[1:57] Okay, water vapor isn't the main cause
[1:59] of global warming,
[2:01] but it is an effect and contributor to it.
[2:04] Oh, I get it!
[2:04] Because of global warming,
[2:06] more water evaporates,
[2:08] so more water goes into the atmosphere,
[2:11] trapping even more heat near the Earth's surface.
[2:14] And the cycle continues.
[2:16] Depending on the type,
[2:17] greenhouse gases can stay in the atmosphere for a few years
[2:21] or even for thousands of years.
[2:24] You're probably wondering,
[2:25] what are some of the effects of these greenhouse gases?
[2:29] Well, when the Earth's temperature rises,
[2:31] that can cause more frequent and intense heat waves,
[2:34] droughts, and floods.
[2:36] The extra CO2 is also changing the ocean's chemistry,
[2:39] affecting marine animals and making it harder for them to survive.
[2:43] But there are ways to prevent things from getting worse.
