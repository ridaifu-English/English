### Lars-Eric Lindblad: A Short History

This is a short history of Mr. Lars-Eric Lindblad, a world-famous tour manager and nature conservationist. He was born in Sweden in 1927 and was brought up there. When he was a child, he was interested in unknown exotic places and great explorers that he read about in books. After he graduated from a university in Switzerland, he moved to the United States in 1951. It was when he was twenty-four years old.

He worked at travel companies for several years and then opened his own company in New York City in 1958. However, it was different from other travel companies. He began a new type of exciting tours with his creative mind. He took his tour groups to Antarctica. Nobody had done this before. In the following year, he took his group to the Galapagos Islands. This was also the first time in the world for tourists to visit the islands. In 1967, he landed on Easter Island with his tourists for the first time. After this, he began commercial trips to China, to African countries, to the Amazon, for example. Also, Mr. Lindblad thought of a unique idea. He gave classes for the travelers to know about their destinations. In other words, his tourists could have fun and learn at the same time.

Mr. Lindblad also believed that travel companies should try to protect the natural environment because it was quite important for them. For this goal, he even bought two islands in the Seychelles to protect their natural environment. He died while he was on vacation in Sweden in 1994. In 1993, his wife, Mrs. Ruriko Hosaka Lindblad, started working as an interpreter and a guide with tour groups. Today she meets many tourists visiting these places each year.
