### Part 5: After You Watch (Think!)

**(Note: Student answers will vary, but should demonstrate understanding and critical thinking. Below are example answers.)**

1.  **What do *you* think is the most important thing to do when you see or hear information online that might be fake?**
    *   *Example Answer:* I think the most important thing is to stop and question the information before believing or sharing it. I shouldn't just assume it's real because it looks convincing.

2.  **Explain your answer** using at least one reason or strategy mentioned in the video (for example, think about checking the source, asking the 5 Ws and 1 H, or considering *why* the information is being shared - see Part 4).
    *   *Example Answer:* The video mentioned using critical thinking and asking the 5 Ws and 1 H, like "Who made this?" and "Why are they showing it?". Checking the **source** [Part 4 word] is important. If the information comes from a random account I don't know, I should be more suspicious than if it comes from a trusted news organization or an official government website. Also, asking "Why?" helps think about if there's a hidden reason, like trying to trick people or make them angry, which relates to **critical** [Part 4 word] thinking.
