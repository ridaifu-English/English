An AI model is in a top fashion magazine. The "perfect-looking" model is wearing clothes from the brand Guess. The editors of the magazine said the AI model was part of an advertising campaign. The company that created the model wants to use "the incredible power of AI to revolutionize marketing images".

Five years ago, a model wrote that AI might replace human models. This might come true. People in the fashion world are now worried. Another model said it was "scary". An eating disorder charity is also worried. It thinks AI models will make people worry about their body shape. This could increase the risk of eating disorders.
