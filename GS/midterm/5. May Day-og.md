Today, I'd like to introduce a German ①( ), “May Day.”
There are three interesting points I'd like to tell you about.
First, I'll start with the purpose of the festival. May Day is for
celebrating the ②( ) of spring. The festival is held in May, so
it is called May Day. It is also celebrated in other European countries
such as the UK.

Second, let me explain how we celebrate the festival. As this
picture shows, people dance around a pole. It is an important part of
the festival. This pole is called the “maypole.” The maypole is a
③( ) pole decorated with flowers. People enjoy dancing
around the pole, holding long ribbons connected to the top.
Third, I'll talk about its history. The festival dates back to ancient
times. The maypole was a symbol of life and spring. People believed
that it could protect them from diseases and evil spirits.
I hope you'll visit Germany and participate in May Day.
