## Teacher Notes

### Facilitation Tips
- **Circulate during research:** Help groups find good sources
- **Check planning tables:** Review before they create Kahoots
- **Test Kahoots:** Play through each one before presentation day
- **Manage time:** Use timers to keep groups on track
- **Encourage collaboration:** Students should discuss and debate

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge:** Students choosing unreliable sources

**Challenge:** Questions too easy or too difficult
- **Solution:** Quality Checker role is crucial; teacher reviews planning tables

**Challenge:** Unequal participation
- **Solution:** Clear role assignments; rotate computer/paper tasks

**Challenge:** Running out of time

### Differentiation Strategies
- **Stronger students:** Can be Research Leaders or Quality Checkers
- **Visual learners:** Focus on finding images, creating visual questions
- **Students who need support:** Pair with helpful teammates, assign Note-Taker role
- **Advanced English:** Can help with question writing and proofreading
