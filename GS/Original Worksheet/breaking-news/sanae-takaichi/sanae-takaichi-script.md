Japan has its first female prime minister. Sanae Takaichi is the country's 104th leader. Takaichi made a deal with a right-wing party to win. However, she has a difficult job. Japanese people want lower food prices and job security. They are worried about the growing number of old people.

Sanae Takaichi has had an interesting life. She played drums in a rock band. She supports Osaka soccer and baseball teams. She also had a powerful motorbike. She lived in the USA and wrote books about politics. She also worked as a TV anchor. Women hope Takaichi will support gender equality and same-sex marriage.
