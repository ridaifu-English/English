Today, we would like to talk about possible problems in the
future of 2050. We are going to talk about three topics.

The first topic is the relationship between AI and work.
In 2050, jobs may be taken away by AI. In particular,
line work in the service industry and manufacturing
industry may be taken away. Because AI has better
processing power than humans in many fields.
As a result, it leads to a decrease in the number
of jobs. On the other hand, it is said that jobs
that are likely not to disappear, such as medical
care and education, will not disappear.
Because AI is not good at reading people's feelings.

The second topic is the change of high-speed rail.
The linear motor car is scheduled to open in Japan in 2027.
As a result, high-speed rail may change from the Shinkansen to linear motor cars.
On the other hand, overseas, it may be possible to do something that spans countries.

Also, let me talk about self-driving cars.
Currently in Japan, fully self-driving cars are not available, but
demonstration experiments are being carried out, so they may
be possible by 2050.

The third topic is the food problem.
The food problem began to be mentioned in 2000.
By 2050, more than half of the food will be imported.
Japan disposes of about 4.92 million Tons per year.
Japan ranks 14th in the ranking of food loss.
The goal is to reduce food loss to 50% by 2030.

That is what we think about 2050.

### Assessment

| Criterion | Score | Comments |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. Correct Use of Useful Expressions | 4/5 | Good use of expressions in the body to show contrast and results. The script is missing a formal concluding phrase. |
| 2. Clarity and Cohesion | 2/5 | The first topic is clear, but the second and third topics are very disorganized. The section on transport jumps between unrelated ideas, and the section on food is just a list of disconnected facts. |
| 3. Grammatical Accuracy | 3/5 | The grammar is mostly understandable, but there are several awkward sentences and minor errors that reduce clarity. |
| 4. Structure (Introduction, Body, Conclusion) | 2/5 | The script has a basic introduction but is missing a proper conclusion. The body's structure is weak, especially in the second and third topics. |
| 5. Fact-Based vs. Opinion-Based Writing | 4/5 | The script is appropriately fact-based and uses statistics. It could be improved by connecting the facts more clearly to build an argument. |
| **Total** | **15/25** | The script has a good fact-based approach and uses some expressions well, but it suffers from poor organization, lack of cohesion, and an absent conclusion. |
