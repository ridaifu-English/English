Today, we would like to talk about if we were school principals for a day.
How we'd improve our school.
Have you ever wondered about school rules are unreasonable?
We will cover three main points. 

First point we want to be able to use my smartphone,
because only our course cannot use smartphones at school.
I think that this is unfair.

Second point. We want to interact with other schools.
Because the more we interact with other schools, the more we can
gain new ideas.

The third point is the school building being poorly located; the road to it is bad.

In conclusion, this school has many areas for improvement.
I can't change all of this in one day, but I will one day!

### Assessment

| Criterion | Score | Comments |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. Correct Use of Useful Expressions | 3/5 | Good use of expressions for the introduction and conclusion, but none are used to connect ideas in the body. |
| 2. Clarity and Cohesion | 2/5 | The script is a simple list of points with very little flow or connection between them. It feels more like notes than a cohesive text. |
| 3. Grammatical Accuracy | 2/5 | There are several grammatical errors and incomplete sentences that make the script unclear and informal. |
| 4. Structure (Introduction, Body, Conclusion) | 2/5 | While there is a basic intro/body/conclusion structure, the body is extremely underdeveloped and the points are not explained. |
| 5. Fact-Based vs. Opinion-Based Writing | 1/5 | The writing is entirely opinion-based ("I think...", "We want..."). It does not present any facts, evidence, or objective arguments. |
| **Total** | **10/25** | The script is very underdeveloped. It needs significant work on developing ideas with evidence, improving grammar, and creating a cohesive body. |
