Bさん   
If you can't go on land, how about going to the sea? The underwater city seems like it would be comfortable because it doesn't get much sunlight, and I heard that an amusement park recently opened there, so I think it would be a good choice.

Today, we would like to talk about "Memories Subscription".  
It is a subscription service that allows you to put other people's memories into your brain and experience them as your own. It is said that by 2050, memory subscriptions will become a part of life.

We will cover three main points. First, we'll talk about the advantages and disadvantages of Memories subscription.

Advantages are that you get to experience things you wouldn't normally get to experience and can rewrite bad memories from the past and provide mental health care.

Disadvantages are you can make memories without going outside, which may become very addictive. Also, if you want to buy better memories, it could cost money, so there may be a gap between rich and poor. But many people can get rich experiences without being limited by  
time or place. People who suffer from strong trauma can feel better by replacing bad memories with warm ones. Difficult skills and arts can also be learned faster. New technology will start to make life full of more possibilities.

1\.  What is a "Memories Subscription"?  
    a) A service to store your own memories online.  
    b) A service that allows you to experience other people's memories.  
    c) A magazine about memory improvement techniques.  
    d) A streaming service for movies about memories.

2\.  What is one advantage of the Memories Subscription service mentioned in the script?  
    a) It helps people to forget their own identity.  
    b) It can provide mental health care by rewriting bad memories.  
    c) It is a completely free service for everyone.  
    d) It encourages people to spend more time outside.

3\.  Why might the Memories Subscription service create a gap between the rich and the poor?  
    a) Because it will only be available in rich countries.  
    b) Because it requires expensive equipment to use.  
    c) Because buying better memories could cost money.  
    d) Because it makes people less motivated to work.

Today, we would like to talk about the impact of Social Media on teenagers. Social media supports our lives on a daily basis. This presentation focuses on the negative influences of using social media on our young people. We will cover three main ideas. First, we will look at mental negative effects. Secondly, we will talk about time. Finally, we will move on to financial aspects.

First of all, if you are a person who uses Social Networking Service, do you care about notifications or what your friends are doing now? If you do, you may be experiencing depression. For example, Social Networking Services like Instagram, X, TikTok and LINE can connect with anyone through their devices. People can post their current situation on the Internet. However, that can make people anxious. For example, "I haven't received a reply from my friend", "My posts are not popular", "Anti-comments are coming" and so on. People unconsciously lower their sense of self-attention. As a result, teenagers are getting depressed before they know it. Moreover, it may lead to the deterioration of relationships or bullying.

Secondly, using social media reduces the time young people spend sleeping. In other words, it will cause insomnia. Also, they lose studying time by using it for a long time. It is not good for them to lose their academic ability. The main reason for this is social media is addictive because SNS displays content which suits our hobbies.) This will decrease the opportunity of face-to-face communication. As a solution, Australia has a law that the age of under 16 don't allow using SNS. Not only looking at smartphones, but this also creates many opportunities to talk to people directly while we are young\!\! Lastly, Social media leads to financial troubles.

One example is you can make money using social media. Youtubers and influencers are examples. People see the photos and videos they posted. The number of views is monetized.  
On the other hand, a dark part-time job is another example in which we get money.  
Young people try to get money easily. Even though we know it is bad, we will lose money & invitations. The important thing is to be doubtful. Let's get the power to tell what is false and what is true\!

The second example is crimes aimed at the elderly. Social media is always around us these days. Teenagers use the Internet since it spreads to the world. How about older people? Some people have no knowledge of the Internet.

The current situation is that financial problems like transfer fraud and credit card fraud targeting such people are increasing. In addition to that, anyone can become a victim because there is a lot of personal information leakage.

From these three points, we could understand the fear of Social media. Social media has a lot of trouble and causes negative impacts for young people's health.  
That's why we young people, teenagers have to be very careful about how we use social media.  
Thank you for listening\!\!

1\.  How can social media negatively affect a teenager's mental health, according to the script?  
    a) By encouraging too much face-to-face communication.  
    b) By making them feel anxious about replies and post popularity.  
    c) By helping them get better grades in school.  
    d) By providing a safe space for all users.

2\.  Why is social media described as being addictive?  
    a) Because it costs a lot of money to use.  
    b) Because it displays content that suits our hobbies.  
    c) Because it helps improve academic ability.  
    d) Because it is required for school homework.

3\.  What is an example of a financial trouble related to social media mentioned in the script?  
    a) The high cost of subscribing to social media platforms.  
    b) The cost of buying new smartphones.  
    c) The risk of losing money through "dark part-time jobs".  
    d) The price of online advertising.

Today, we would like to talk about the reform of school rules. This presentation will focus on school rules. In this presentation, we will discuss the reform of school rules.

I want to talk about the benefits of remote learning. First, we don't have to go to school, so we save time and feel less tired. We can use that extra time to study, rest, or enjoy hobbies. Second, we can learn at our own pace. If classes are recorded, we can watch difficult parts again and again to understand better. Also, with the internet, we can join classes from anywhere. Even if we don't feel well, we can keep learning. Remote learning is very useful and offers a new, flexible way to study.

Having a microwave at school is helpful. Students can warm their food during lunch time. It saves time and makes eating more comfortable. Warm food is better for health and taste. Also, students do not need to bring cold meals. A microwave makes school life easier and more enjoyable.

We need stronger internet connections in schools. Good internet connections help students study online and use digital tools. It makes learning fun and fast. Teachers can also use videos and websites. With strong internet connections, schools can prepare for the future and support every student better.

In conclusion, by making school classes remote, putting a microwave, and making the internet connection stronger, school life will be better for students, and teachers will have less work.  
Thank you for listening.

    a) It helps them make more friends at school.  
    b) It allows them to save time and feel less tired.  
    c) It ensures they get more physical exercise.  
    d) It provides more opportunities for face-to-face interaction with teachers.

2\.  What is one reason the script gives for having a microwave at school?  
    a) It helps students cook complex meals.  
    b) It makes the school cafeteria more crowded.

Today, we would like to talk about possible problems in the future of 2050\. We are going to talk about three topics.

The first topic is the relationship between AI and work. In 2050, jobs may be taken away by AI. In particular, line work in the service industry and manufacturing industry may be taken away. Because AI has better processing power than humans in many fields. As a result, it leads to a decrease in the number of jobs. On the other hand, it is said that jobs that are likely not to disappear, such as medical care and education, will not disappear. Because AI is not good at reading people's feelings.

The second topic is the change of high-speed rail. The linear motor car is scheduled to open in Japan in 2027\. As a result, high-speed rail may change from the Shinkansen to linear motor cars. On the other hand, overseas, it may be possible to do something that spans countries.

Also, let me talk about self-driving cars. Currently in Japan, fully self-driving cars are not available, but demonstration experiments are being carried out, so they may  
be possible by 2050\.

The third topic is the food problem. The food problem began to be mentioned in 2000\. By 2050, more than half of the food will be imported. Japan disposes of about 4.92 million Tons per year.  
Japan ranks 14th in the ranking of food loss. The goal is to reduce food loss to 50% by 2030\.

That is what we think about 2050\.

1\.  Why might AI take away jobs in the service and manufacturing industries?  
    a) Because AI is better at reading people's feelings.  
    b) Because AI has better processing power than humans in many fields.  
    c) Because AI is cheaper to maintain than human workers.  
    d) Because AI can work longer hours without rest.

2\.  What type of jobs does the script say are not likely to disappear?  
    a) Jobs in the service industry.  
    b) Jobs in the manufacturing industry.  
    c) Jobs such as medical care and education.  
    d) Jobs related to transportation.

3\.  What is Japan's goal regarding food loss by 2030?  
    a) To increase food imports.  
    b) To dispose of 4.92 million tons of food per year.  
    c) To become number one in the food loss ranking.  
    d) To reduce food loss to 50%.

Today, we would like to talk about "The Impact of Social Media on Teenagers."  
This presentation will focus on negative impacts. We will cover three main points.

First, it is known that about 80% of Japanese people suffer from insomnia. Young people use the Internet late at night, from 1 a.m. to 3 a.m. The main reasons for this are to feel less stress and to get away from their life. For example, they use it when they want to relax after finishing their activities during the day or when they want to get away from the worries of reality. We think it is important to have a regular routine, make the bedroom comfortable, and make exercise a habit.

Second, using SNS may cause eyesight problems. In fact, the number of children with poor eyesight has been increasing since the 2000s when people began to use SNS. Particularly, using social media for long periods without breaks can cause eye damage.

Third, SNS leads to a lack of exercise. Using social media for a long time increases sitting time and leads to a lack of exercise. However, it can also encourage exercise through information like training methods and interactions.

In conclusion, social media has a lot of negative effects, but it can be helpful if we don't overuse it.

We hope this presentation has given you a better understanding of the impact of social media on teenagers. Thank you for listening.

1\.  Why do young people use the internet late at night, according to the script?  
    a) To do their homework.  
    b) To feel less stress and get away from their life.  
    c) To talk to their parents.  
    d) To learn new things for school.

2\.  What health problem has been increasing in children since the 2000s, alongside the rise of SNS?  
    a) Insomnia  
    b) Poor eyesight  
    c) Lack of exercise  
    d) Stress

3\.  How does the script say using social media can lead to a lack of exercise?  
    a) It makes people too tired to exercise.  
    b) It encourages unhealthy eating habits.  
    c) It increases sitting time.  
    d) It causes eye damage, making exercise difficult.

"Our Vision for the Future: Life in 2050"

Today, we would like to talk about The global problem 30 years from now. This presentation will focus on Global warming, Nankai Trough Earthquake and low birthrate and aging population.  
Have you ever wondered about these?

First of all,let's talk about the problem of global warming thirty years later. The first is the temperature rise. It is said that the average temperature will rise by 1.5 to 2.5 degrees in thirty years. The second is the issue of agriculture and food production. As the temperature rises, the amount of food harvested decreases. Because of that, the price of food will increase.

Next is about the Nankai Trough earthquake. It is said that the Nankai Trough will have an earthquake with a magnitude of 7\. It is said to occur within 30 years. It is said that about 300,000 people will die. Shikoku's the most dangerous area in Japan. Hokkaido is the safest area in Japan.

In 30 years, there will be fewer children and more old people. This means fewer workers and more people who need help. It will be hard for the country to pay for healthcare and pensions. Schools may close, and more hospitals will be needed. To fix this, countries may use robots, let more people move in, or change the rules to help everyone.

In 30 years, the Earth will be warmer, and food will be harder to grow. A big earthquake may hit Japan, causing many deaths. There will be fewer young people and more old people. Robots, more workers from other countries, and new rules can help solve these problems.

1\.  What is one expected consequence of global warming mentioned in the script?  
    a) The average temperature will decrease.  
    b) The price of food will decrease.  
    c) The amount of food harvest will decrease.  
    d) It will become easier to grow crops.

2\.  How many deaths are predicted to be caused by the Nankai Trough earthquake?  
    a) 1.5 to 2.5 million people.  
    b) About 300,000 people.  
    c) 30,000 people.  
    d) It is not mentioned.

3\.  What is a potential solution mentioned in the script for the problems caused by a low birthrate and aging population?  
    a) Closing all hospitals.  
    b) Reducing the number of workers.  
    c) Using robots and allowing more people to move in.  
    d) Increasing pensions for everyone.
