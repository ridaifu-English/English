## **Part B: Complete the Paragraphs**

**Paragraph 1** (Add an example)
Regular exercise is essential for maintaining good health. **For example, a person who jogs for 30 minutes three times a week can significantly reduce their risk of heart disease and diabetes. Additionally, people who engage in regular physical activity often report better sleep quality and higher energy levels throughout the day.** This shows how important it is to stay physically active throughout our lives.

**Paragraph 2** (Add a fact/statistic)
Social media has become an integral part of teenagers' daily lives. **According to a 2023 study by the Pew Research Center, 95% of teenagers have access to a smartphone, and the average teen spends over 7 hours per day on social media platforms. The same research shows that 45% of teenagers report being online "almost constantly."** This demonstrates the significant impact of social media on young people today.

**Paragraph 3** (Add a counter-example)
Many people believe that technology makes life easier and more convenient. **However, critics point out that our increasing dependence on technology has led to several problems. For instance, many people now struggle with face-to-face communication skills, and the constant notifications from devices can cause stress and anxiety rather than convenience.** Therefore, we must carefully consider both benefits and drawbacks of technological advancement.

## **Part C: Build Complete Paragraphs**

**Topic Sentence 1:** Learning a second language provides numerous benefits for students.

**Sample Answer:**
Learning a second language provides numerous benefits for students. First, bilingual individuals often demonstrate enhanced cognitive abilities, including better problem-solving skills and improved memory. According to research published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology, people who speak multiple languages show greater mental flexibility and can switch between tasks more efficiently than monolingual speakers. For example, students who study Japanese while speaking English as their first language often report improved analytical thinking when approaching complex mathematical problems. Furthermore, language learning opens up cultural understanding and global career opportunities. Therefore, schools should encourage all students to pursue second language education as it contributes to both academic success and personal development.

**Topic Sentence 2:** Environmental protection should be a priority for all governments.

**Sample Answer:**
Environmental protection should be a priority for all governments. The current state of our planet demands immediate action, as scientific evidence clearly shows the devastating effects of climate change. According to NASA data, global temperatures have risen by 1.1 degrees Celsius since the late 19th century, with the most dramatic warming occurring in the past 40 years. For instance, countries like Denmark and Costa Rica have successfully implemented renewable energy programs, with Denmark generating over 50% of its electricity from wind power. As environmental scientist Dr. James Hansen warns, "We have a very brief window of opportunity to deal with climate change before it becomes irreversible." Although some argue that environmental policies may slow economic growth, the long-term costs of environmental damage far exceed the initial investment in green technologies. Governments must act now to ensure a sustainable future for coming generations.

## **Part D: Improving Weak Paragraphs**

**Original Weak Paragraph:**
"Video games are bad for children. They are violent and waste time. Parents should not let their kids play them. Children should do other things instead."

**Improved Paragraph - Sample Answer:**
While video games can provide entertainment and educational benefits, excessive gaming can have negative effects on children's development. Research conducted by the American Academy of Pediatrics shows that children who play violent video games for more than two hours daily demonstrate increased aggressive behavior and decreased empathy towards others. For example, a longitudinal study following 3,000 children over two years found that those exposed to violent gaming content were 24% more likely to engage in physical fights at school. However, not all video games are harmful - educational games can actually improve problem-solving skills and hand-eye coordination. As child psychologist Dr. Sarah Martinez explains, "The key is moderation and parental guidance in selecting age-appropriate content." Therefore, parents should monitor their children's gaming habits and encourage a balanced lifestyle that includes physical activity, social interaction, and academic pursuits alongside moderate, supervised gaming time.
