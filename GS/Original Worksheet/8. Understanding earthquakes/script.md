# All About Earthquakes! - Video Script
Level: Beginner

[0:06] Earthquakes are one of the Earth's most powerful natural phenomena.
[0:09] Hold on tight, because we're going to find out just what makes the earth quake.
[0:15] (Transition sound)
[0:16] An earthquake is an intense shaking of the Earth's surface, caused by the release of energy from the Earth's crust.
[0:23] The Earth's crust is made up of seven major tectonic plates.
[0:27] The cracks between the plates are called faults.
[0:30] Fault lines can be big, like this one in Iceland,
[0:34] or smaller, like this one in Mexico.
[0:37] Scientists are learning more about what can cause earthquakes.
[0:40] But here's what we do know.
[0:42] The tectonic plates shift and move.
[0:44] Plates can collide or slide against each other,
[0:47] causing friction.
[0:49] All that energy builds up, and once it's released, it causes an earthquake.
[0:54] Large seismic waves of energy travel to the Earth's surface,
[0:58] causing it to shake.
[1:01] Earthquakes happen all over the world,
[1:03] but there are some areas where they happen more often.
[1:07] The footage you just watched at the beginning of this video is from an earthquake in Japan in January of 2024.
[1:14] Japan sits on top of four major tectonic plates.
[1:18] This makes it prone to earthquakes.
[1:21] Earthquakes happen in Canada, too.
[1:23] The Geological Survey of Canada records and locates, on average, more than 4,000 earthquakes each year.
[1:31] That's about 11 per day,
[1:34] but only about 50 a year are actually felt.
[1:37] Most earthquakes happen along active plate boundaries off the British Columbia coast.
[1:43] Did you know earthquakes and volcanoes are related?
[1:46] Volcanoes typically form along tectonic plate boundaries.
[1:50] Earthquake experts can help predict when a volcanic eruption is coming because of earthquake activity.
[1:56] Magma pushes up through the Earth's crust,
[1:59] causing tremors.
[2:01] In 2023 in Iceland, people living near a volcano were able to evacuate safely because of earthquakes that happened weeks before an eruption.
[2:10] You can learn all about volcanoes by watching our video.

[2:15] Now, there are a lot of earthquake myths out there.
[2:18] Time to play a little true or false, earthquake edition.
[2:22] True or false? Animals can sense when an earthquake is going to strike.
[2:28] False.
[2:29] Animals don't have the ability to predict when an earthquake is coming.
[2:34] But some animals can feel smaller movements in the ground that humans might not be able to detect.
[2:41] True or false? Earthquakes occur during earthquake weather.
[2:46] False.
[2:47] Earthquakes happen during all types of weather,
[2:50] but lots of rain during or after an earthquake can make the effects worse.
[2:55] It can create landslides and make rescue efforts more challenging.
