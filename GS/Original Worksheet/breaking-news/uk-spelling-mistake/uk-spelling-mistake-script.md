# UK Opposition Party Spells 'Britain' Incorrectly - Script

Everyone makes spelling mistakes. In the UK, a political party misspelled the name of its own country. The mistake was on a chocolate bar. The word "Britain" was spelt "Britian". The political party was giving the chocolate to people at an event. The party said the mistake was because of a "printing error".

Social media laughed at the mistake. A journalist wrote that the party couldn't spell the name of its country. A different party said the political party "can't proofread". Earlier this year, another party misspelt the word "Scottish". It made a handout that said "Your Scotish Labour candidate," missing a "t".
