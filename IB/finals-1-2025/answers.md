1.  **AI Language Practice:** I believe using AI for foreign language practice is an excellent idea. AI tutors are available 24/7, allowing for flexible practice sessions. They can offer instant feedback on pronunciation and grammar without judgment, which can be very encouraging for learners. Furthermore, AI can personalize lessons based on an individual's progress and learning style, making the experience more efficient and effective.
2.  **Plastic Bags vs. Reusable Bags:** It is undoubtedly better for people to bring reusable bags from home rather than using plastic bags from stores. Plastic bags contribute significantly to pollution, clogging landfills and harming wildlife, especially marine animals. By using our own bags, we can drastically reduce single-use plastic consumption. This simple habit is a powerful collective action towards environmental conservation and a more sustainable future for everyone.
