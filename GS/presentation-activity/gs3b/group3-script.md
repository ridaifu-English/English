The Impact of Social Media on Teenagers: Finding a Healthy Balance

Today, we would like to talk about the impact of Social Media on teenagers.
Social media supports our lives on a daily basis.
This presentation focuses on the negative influences of using social media on our young people. We will cover three main ideas.
First, we will look at mental negative effects. Secondly, we will talk about time.
Finally, we will move on to financial aspects.

First of all, if you are a person who uses Social Networking Service, do you care about notifications or what your friends are doing now?
If you do, you may be experiencing depression.
For example, Social Networking Service like Instagram, X, TikTok and LINE can connect with anyone through their devices. People can post their current situation on the Internet.
However, that can make people anxious.
For example, "I haven't received a reply from my friend", "My post are not popular", "Anti-comments are coming" and so on. People unconsciously lower their sense of self-attention.
As a result, teenagers are getting depressed before they know it.
Moreover, it may lead to the deterioration of relationships or bullying.

Secondly, using social media reduces the time young people spend sleeping. In other words, it will cause insomnia.
Also, they lose studying time by using it for a long time.
It is not good for them to lose their academic ability.
The main reason for this is social media is addictive because SNS displays content which suits our hobbies.)
This will decrease the opportunity of face-to-face communication.
As a solution, Australia has a law that the age of under 16 don't allow using SNS.
Not only looking at smartphones, but this also creates many opportunities to talk to
people directly while we are young!!
Lastly, Social media leads to financial troubles.

One example is you can make money using social media.
Youtubers and influencers are example.
People see the photos and videos they posted. The number of views is monetized.
On the other hand, a dark part-time job is another example which we get money.
Young people try to get money easily. Even though we know it is bad, we will lose money & invitation.
The important thing is to be doubtful. Let's get the power to tell what is false and what is true!

The second example is crimes aimed at the elderly.
Social media is always around us these days.
Teenager use the Internet since it spreads to the world.
How about older people? Some people have no knowledge of the Internet.

The current situation is that financial problems like a transfer fraud and a credit
card fraud targeting such people are increasing.
In addition to that, anyone can become a victim because there is a lot of personal informations leakage.

From these three points, we could understand scary of the Social media.
Social media have a lot of trouble and cause negative impacts
for young people's health.
That's why we young people, teenagers have to be very careful about how we use social media.
Thank you for listening!!
