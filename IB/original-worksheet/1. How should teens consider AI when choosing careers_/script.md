# AI and Your Future Job - Video Script

Level: Beginner

[00:00] Hi, I'm Arjun Ram and I'm a CBC Kids News contributor. I'm in the 12th grade and I'm already making decisions about university and future career choices. It got me thinking about A.I. and new technologies in the workplace. So I'm here at a school in North York to observe a Google presentation and talk to kids with similar questions.
[00:19] Let's do it. ♪ [light] All right everyone, so we're going to welcome Komal over here from Google to talk to us about A.I. So actually, what is A.I., right? I think we all know it stands for artificial intelligence.
[00:30]  Another way I like  to describe it  is that it's  augmented imagination.
(00:44)  And basically it's a way to make  computers think a little  bit more like humans.
[00:48] Arjun: I'm in Grade 12  and I'm obviously looking at  future career paths and  things that I want to pursue. But the question of A.I. is always in my mind, you know. Maybe I should change my career path because of new technologies that are on the uprise.
[01:01] Right. So I do not know if you need to change your field. But I think you need to be very aware of how A.I. could impact your field.
[01:04]  Can some of you throw a  few things at me of what do you want to be when you grow up?
-Yeah. -A paediatrician.
 Oh, very cool. Lawyer.
 Lawyer.  Nice. [indistinct chatting]
[01:19] ♪ [reflective]
[01:21] Arjun: What do  you think about  A.I.
(01:24)  making an impact  in your field of  medicine in the future when  you're trying to get jobs?
[01:27] People instead of just actually going to real doctors, they google themselves and perhaps that could be the wrong diagnosis.
[01:33] Arjun: Would it ever make you think about changing your career choice?
[01:36] Well, if it takes over and then we're not actually able to, like, do our job like how we want to, then I would say yeah.
[01:42] ♪ ♪ Your mom's a social worker. Do you think that A.I. might take away from the real essence of what it's supposed to be?
[01:54] When it comes to social working, social working requires a lot of feelings, emotions, something that A.I. doesn't really feel at all. That's why jobs like a therapist, A.I.
[02:08]  cannot really take over since A.I. can't really feel emotions.
[02:08] So now I have a lot of thoughts about some of the decisions I have to make on my own. So who better to talk to than the school's guidance counsellor?
[02:17] ♪ ♪ Hi, Miss Greco. Thank you so much for doing this.
-Hi. Thanks for coming.
-Nice to meet you. Thank you.
[02:22] So I'm very interested in broadcasting.
(02:25) I mean it's why I do this, why I'm doing this right now. It's my dream, something that I want to do in life. What would you tell someone like me who's interested in that field but is also thinking about A.I. and its impact?
[02:36] I think A.I. in broadcasting may be used -more as an enhancement -OK. -to support, to help because you always still want to have that human touch and that human experience.
[02:47] But speak to your - speak to your professors, go to the guidance office, ask around, you know, in terms of what does the future look like? Talk to people in the industry.
[02:56] ♪ ♪ How do you think A.I. will play in the field of acting, in public speaking and media and things like that?
[03:05] Yeah, well, A.I. (03:09)  taking place of many jobs causes financial problems and people's jobs are taken up.
[03:11] He also wants to be in the military. So A.I. can help, like, form different kinds of ammunition or like  different ways of  training for stuff.
[03:19] Komal: Yeah, yeah. Thank you. Those are great thoughts.
[03:25] For a wrap I would say, stay curious.
[03:28] Stay cautious. And stay involved.
