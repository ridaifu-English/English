---

## Worksheet Structure

### Part 1: Gap Fill Exercise (5 questions)
- Focus on **connectors** (e.g., because, but, first, second, if, however, so)
- Present key dialogue excerpts with blanks for connectors
- Do NOT create blanks for content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives)
- Students listen and fill in the missing connectors

**Example format:**
```
**Speaker A:** I couldn't sleep well last night (1) __________ I took a long nap.
**Speaker B:** That happened to me before, (2) __________ I found effective ways recently.
```

### Part 2: Listening Comprehension (5 questions)
- Create 5 comprehension questions that test understanding of:
  - Main problems/situations
  - Key facts and details
  - Specific information (numbers, times, names, etc.)
  - Cause and effect relationships
  - Advice or recommendations given

**Format:** Simple numbered questions without answer lines

**Example:**
```
1. What is [Character's] problem?
2. What does [Character] recommend?
```

---

### Part 3: True or False (5 questions)
- Create 5 True/False statements
- Mix true and false statements
- Test key facts from the dialogue
- Include at least one statement that requires careful listening (subtle details)

**Format:** Statement followed by **T / F**

**Example:**
```
1. [Character] looks energetic today. **T / F**
2. A 30-minute nap is the best length according to [Character]. **T / F**
```

### Part 4: Critical Thinking (1 question only)
- Create ONE open-ended question that:
  - Requires students to apply knowledge from the dialogue
  - Encourages creative or analytical thinking
  - Asks students to design, explain, or evaluate something
  - References the advice or information from the dialogue

**Example prompts:**
- "If you were designing a [X], what would it look like and why? Consider [Character's] advice."
- "How would you solve [problem from dialogue]? Explain your reasoning."
- "Do you agree with [Character's] opinion? Why or why not?"
