Good morning, class. Today's topic is unique taxes in the world. First, in Japan, we have a tax on hot springs. When we take a bath in a hot spring, we need to pay the tax. Next, in Taiwan and Romania, they have a tax called a junk food tax. When people buy junk food, they have to pay the tax. Another unique tax is a dog tax. In some European countries, such as Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, dog owners are required to pay the tax. It is said that the first dog tax was introduced in England at the end of the 18th century. At that time, England needed a lot of money to fight a war against France. So, the government decided to put taxes on many things including dogs. England doesn't have this tax anymore, but it still remains in some countries today for different reasons.
