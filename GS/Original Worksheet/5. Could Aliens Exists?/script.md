# Could Aliens Exist? - Video Script
Level: Beginner

[0:04] Oh good, Captain, you're awake.
[0:06] You just missed the mission briefing.
[0:08] But I can fill you in.
[0:10] First, you're gonna want to see this.
[0:13] (News clip montage starts - News anchor speaking)
[0:13] Now human and alien conspiracies, well they are front and center once again.
[0:17] Witnesses with military backgrounds told members of Congress that the government is holding back information on what it knows.
[0:24] The Pentagon has denied the claims.
[0:27] (Girl reappears) Back on Earth, people are talking about whether aliens exist.
[0:31] Our mission is to find out how likely it is according to science.
[0:35] By the way, I know we're not on a real spaceship, but you're still going to want to strap in
[0:40] because this stuff might blow your mind.
[0:42] (Hyperspace effect with title card: KN EXPLAINS: COULD ALIENS EXIST?)
[0:50] Oh, Captain, we just heard directly from NASA.
[0:53] They say they've confirmed 5,000 planets outside our solar system.
[0:57] But there could be hundreds of billions more
[1:00] in and beyond our galaxy.
[1:04] Our NASA expert said there's too many unknowns to calculate the exact probability of aliens existing.
[1:10] But bottom line, it's pretty likely that something is out there.
[1:14] We just haven't found it yet.
[1:16] As you know, Captain, most people think aliens might look like this.
[1:20] But what if they looked more like this microscopic animal? (Shows Tardigrade)
[1:25] First, there's life as we know it.
[1:26] These are things that need a comfortable climate, water, and energy to survive.
[1:31] Aliens could surprise us and be a mix of all these things on Earth.
[1:34] Who knows?
[1:36] Here's where things get tricky, Captain.
[1:38] There's also life as we don't know it.
[1:41] Like, what if alien life doesn't need water or oxygen?
[1:44] Even on our planet, there are life forms that survive in environments that would usually kill anything else.
[1:50] Like that tardigrade I showed you earlier.
[1:52] It's called an extremophile
[1:54] because it can survive in extreme heat,
[1:56] extreme cold,
[1:57] at the bottom of the ocean,
[1:59] and even in the vacuum of space.
[2:02] So, while some scientists are first focusing on looking for planets with conditions that could support life familiar to us,
[2:09] there could be alien life forms that survive in completely different environments.
[2:14] So, we've got to keep an open mind.
[2:16] Alright Captain, other teams have been using technology that can help us with our mission.
[2:21] For example, the Mars Perseverance Rover.
[2:23] It's a machine that was sent to Mars to collect samples and look for signs of ancient life.
[2:28] Here, let me show you another thing.
[2:31] (Hyperspace effect)
[2:36] This is the James Webb Telescope.
[2:38] It helps scientists by sending back pictures of stars and galaxies.
[2:42] It can even help them look for possible signs of life in other planets' atmospheres.
[2:46] But there's still room for improvement.
[2:48] We need bigger and better telescopes to see things with more detail.
[2:53] And info from NASA shows that they're working on this technology right now.
[2:57] Plus, a way to fix them, like robots that would travel with the telescope to fix it if things went wrong.
[3:04] Whoa! Uh...
[3:06] Don't worry, I don't think that's this telescope.
[3:08] I think it's actually...
[3:10] (Glitch effect reveals girl in her bedroom)
[3:11] us.
[3:12] Okay, so our mission may not be real.
[3:15] But this search really is happening.
[3:17] We could find an alien that waves back at us.
[3:20] Or we could find a microbe.
[3:22] Because of these possibilities, and because of how vast the universe is,
[3:26] scientists say it's pretty likely that aliens are out there.
[3:29] I guess that means we accomplished our mission.
