1 minute podcast for beginner English learners. Speak clearly and in a informative tone.
Female: Recently, a K-pop group gave a speech at the International SDG's meeting. Did you know that?
Male: Yes, I saw it on the internet. They were dressed in eco-friendly suits.
Female: You're right. The members chose upcycled clothes for the speech to show their concern for the environment.
Male: Upcycled? What does it mean?
Female: Upcycle means using waste to create products that are better than the original ones. The group members' suits were made of wasted clothes, but they looked cool.
Male: Upcycle sounds very new to me.
Female: That's true for many people in the world. That's why the group wanted to spread the idea by wearing the upcycled suits.
Male: I got it. We should work together for SDGs and protect the environment.
