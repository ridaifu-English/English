### Assessment

| Criterion | Level | Score | Comments |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Useful Expressions** | Needs Improvement | 2/5 | Only one introductory phrase was used. The script lacks expressions for the body and conclusion. |
| **2. Clarity and Cohesion** | Needs Improvement | 2/5 | The script feels like three separate parts pasted together with no transitions. Several sentences are unclear or poorly constructed. |
| **3. Grammatical Accuracy** | Needs Improvement | 2/5 | There are multiple grammatical errors, including sentence fragments ("It well-known") and run-on sentences. |
| **4. Structure** | Needs Improvement | 2/5 | There is a weak introduction, a disjointed body, and no conclusion. The overall structure is very poor. |
| **5. Fact-Based vs. Opinion**| Needs Improvement | 2/5 | The script mixes facts (location) with unsupported opinions ("so delicious"). It does not cite sources and reads more like a review. |
| **Total** | | **10/25** | **Overall:** This script attempts to be informative but suffers from a lack of structure, cohesion, and grammatical accuracy. It requires significant revision to meet the assignment criteria.
