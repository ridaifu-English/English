  - Disadvantages: May not develop critical thinking, narrow focus
- Schools teaching traditional subjects:
  - Advantages: Students learn to think deeply, can adapt to many jobs
  - Disadvantages: Students may not have practical skills employers want
- Students should reference the concern that young people lack experience and skills that companies want
- Balanced approach: Perhaps schools need both practical skills AND traditional education
