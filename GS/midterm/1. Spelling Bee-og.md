Kate : My sister in the US, Sarah, is taking part in a spelling bee this Sunday!
Wataru: Spelling bee? ①( ) that?
K : ②( ) a spelling contest. People compete to spell words correctly. For example, if the word “soccer” is read aloud, the participant on the stage would say, “S-O-C-C-E-R.”
W: Does that mean the participants need to remember the spellings of words?
K : Exactly. They must remember a wide variety of words, including some technical terms.
W: Wow! Who can join the contest?
K : In Sarah’s competition, anyone younger than 15 can participate. Usually, over 50 students participate in the first round. But only eight students can go to the final round after winning a lot of rounds.
W : ③( ) hard, isn’t it? I hope ④( ) do her best and win the contest!
