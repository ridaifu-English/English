## Part 6: After You Watch - Think!
(Suggested Answers - Student answers will vary)

1.  The video presents different views on A.I.'s impact on jobs (e.g., medicine, social work, broadcasting). Do you believe A.I. will ultimately create more job opportunities than it eliminates, or will it lead to widespread job loss? Explain your perspective.
    <br>
    *Example supporting job creation:* I believe A.I. will create more jobs. While some routine tasks might be automated, new roles will emerge in developing, managing, and maintaining A.I. systems. A.I. can also augment human capabilities, leading to new types of services and industries. For example, in broadcasting, A.I. might handle data analysis or initial script drafts, allowing humans to focus on more creative or in-depth aspects.
    <br>
    *Example supporting job loss:* I am concerned that A.I. might lead to widespread job loss. Many jobs that involve repetitive tasks, data processing, or even some creative work could be performed more efficiently by A.I. While new jobs related to A.I. will be created, they might not be enough to offset the losses in other sectors, or they might require skills that many people don't have.
