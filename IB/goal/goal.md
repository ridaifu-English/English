## goal/plan

The IB goal is to prepare for the EE (Extended Essay). 

This Logic and Expression class needs to enhance the students' ability to be able to 

1) Teach them the correct use of grammar and vocabulary
2) Teach them the correct use of academic writing
3) Teach them various grammar structures (infinitive, gerund, etc.)
5) Make them able to write their own opinion with supporting evidence so their essay is strong and convincing

Every Friday, they will have 2 lessons with each being 45 minutes long.

My plan is to use 1 lesson to teach the grammar by using the textbook. The first 25 minutes will be explaining the grammar and the rest will be doing exercises.

The second lessson will be expressing their own opinion. This needs to be done by using the knowledge they have learned in the first lesson and also interactive and fun.
