John: We are graduating from high school soon. What is your future goal, Mei?
Mei: Well, I'm interested in space, so I want to be an astronaut if I have a chance.
John: Wow, that's cool. Why do you want to be an astronaut?
Mei: Since I was a child, I have loved watching stars. That has made me dream of seeing the Earth from space someday.
John: Oh. I heard many astronauts saying it was beautiful. What do you want to do as an astronaut?
Mei: I want to solve the problem of space debris, which is waste flying around the Earth.
John: Space debris seems like a big problem these days, so human beings have to do something.
Mei: Right. That's why I want to join a mission to collect space debris. By doing so, people on the Earth can live safely and enjoy watching the beautiful stars.
