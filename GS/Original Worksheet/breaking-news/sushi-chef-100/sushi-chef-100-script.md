# Sushi Chef Working at 100 - Script

A sushi chef in Japan is still working, on his 100th birthday. His name is Jiro Ono. Earlier this week, Tokyo's governor asked him about his secret to a long life. He replied, 'To work.' He said: 'Even at 100 years old, I'll try to work…The best medicine is to work.' He said he plans to keep working for five more years.

Jiro Ono was born in 1925. He started working when he was seven. He became a sushi chef in 1951. He opened a small sushi bar in Tokyo. There, he spent many years trying to make the perfect sushi. In 2011, a movie was made about Ono called 'Jiro Dreams of Sushi'. In the film, he talked about reaching 'perfection'.
