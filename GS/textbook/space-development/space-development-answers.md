#### Part 4: Critical Thinking

**Sample Answer:**

If I were an astronaut working on the space debris problem, I would propose using a robotic spacecraft with a large net or magnetic arm to capture space debris. The spacecraft would:
- Identify and track pieces of space debris using advanced sensors
- Capture the debris with a specialized net or magnetic system
- Either bring the debris back to Earth to be burned up in the atmosphere, or collect it in a special container in space
- Work automatically without putting human astronauts at risk

This solution would be effective because it could operate continuously without endangering human lives, and it would help keep Earth safe while preserving the beauty of the night sky, which is important to Mei. The robotic system could collect many pieces of debris efficiently, making space safer for future missions and satellites.

*Note: Student answers may vary. Look for responses that propose a specific solution and explain why it would be effective, referencing the concerns mentioned in the dialogue (safety and preserving the beauty of the stars).*
