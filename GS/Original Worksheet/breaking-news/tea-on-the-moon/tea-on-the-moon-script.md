# Tea on the Moon - Script

Researchers say we could grow tea on the Moon. They said they were "at the very earliest stages of research into space agriculture". This might mean astronauts could take part in the British tradition of having a tea break. It could also be good news for farmers who have problems growing plants in bad soil.

The researchers wanted to know if plants could grow on the Moon and Mars. They made a special soil like the soil found there. The soil and special greenhouses in space could give astronauts fresh food. A researcher was happy that tea might be grown on the Moon. However, she said tea might not grow on Mars.
