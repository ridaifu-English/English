##### 3. 下記の文章を読み、以下の問いに答えなさい。(各2点)

Have you ever heard of "green roofs"? They are roofs of buildings that are covered with plants.

Green roofs are becoming popular  especially in large cities  because they are good for the environment.  In summer,  cities are often hotter  than other areas.  Green roofs keep buildings cool  ①(&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;) electricity.  These buildings produce less CO₂ because they do not use much air conditioning.  Furthermore,  plants on the roofs take in CO₂. 

Green roofs may sound new, but actually they have a long history. In Norway, farmhouses have had grass roofs for centuries. In Japan, people have had straw-roof houses ②(&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;) thousands of years. These traditional roofs show ancient people's wisdom.

In many cities, the natural environment has been replaced ③(&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;) buildings. Green roofs may be an effective way for people in cities to live in harmony with nature.

As you can see, Russia produces the most buckwheat among the three countries, while Japan produces the least.

Kasha is similar to Japanese rice porridge.

Unlike Russia, the consumption of buckwheat in France is higher than its production. France consumes imported buckwheat as well as domestically grown buckwheat. In France, buckwheat is often used for making crepes and pancakes.

Hi, everyone. In our biology class, Ms. Sato mentioned that animals have great ①(&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;). For example, many of you know dogs can smell far ②(&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;) than us. Then, I wondered if other animals have such abilities, so I did some research on birds. They have some amazing abilities. Let me talk about ③(&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)(&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;) found.

Do you know how fast birds can fly? The fastest one is said to be a falcon, or *hayabusa*. It can fly more than 300 km per hour, especially when it is trying to catch small animals for food. Also, a swallow, or *tsubame*, can fly about 200 km per hour when escaping from an enemy. Because of their speed, their names are used for the Shinkansen.

As I have explained, dogs and birds have great abilities. Other animals also have amazing abilities. We humans should respect all living things on earth.

(11) 文章中の空所①,②,③に最も適切な語句を、それぞれ英語で書き入れなさい。
