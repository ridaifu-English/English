Today, we would like to talk the reform of school rules.
This presentation will focus on school rules.
In this presentation, we will discuss about
the reform of school rules.

I want to talk about the benefits of remote learning.
First, we don't have to go to school, so we save time and feel less tired.
We can use that extra time to study, rest, or enjoy hobbies.
Second, we can learn at our own pace.
If classes are recorded, we can watch difficult parts again and again to understand better.
Also, with the internet, we can join classes from anywhere.
Even if we don't feel well, we can keep learning.
Remote learning is very useful and offers a new, flexible way to study.

Having a microwave at school is helpful. Students can warm their food during lunch time. It saves
time and makes eating more comfortable. Warm food is better for health and
taste. Also, students do not need to bring cold meals. A microwave makes school life easier and more enjoyable.

We need stronger internet connections in schools.
Good internet connections help students study online and use digital tools. It makes learning fun and fast. Teachers can also use videos and websites. With strong internet connections, schools can prepare for the future and support every student better.

In conclusion, by making school classes remote, putting a microwave, and making the internet connection stronger, school life will be better for students, and teachers will have less work.
Thank you for listening.

### Assessment

| Criterion | Score | Comments |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. Correct Use of Useful Expressions | 3/5 | The script uses introductory and concluding phrases, but the introduction is repetitive and contains grammatical errors. More transitional phrases are needed in the body. |
| 2. Clarity and Cohesion | 3/5 | Each point is clear, but there are no transitions between the different sections (remote learning, microwaves, internet), making the script feel disconnected. |
| 3. Grammatical Accuracy | 3/5 | The body of the text is mostly grammatically correct, but there are several errors in the introduction (e.g., "talk the reform," "discuss about"). |
| 4. Structure (Introduction, Body, Conclusion) | 3/5 | The script has an intro, body, and conclusion, but the introduction is weak and does not outline the points. The body needs better transitions. |
| 5. Fact-Based vs. Opinion-Based Writing | 2/5 | The arguments are based on general reasoning and personal desire ("I want to...") rather than on facts, data, or evidence. |
| **Total** | **14/25** | The script presents clear ideas but needs significant improvement in its introduction, use of evidence, and overall cohesion. |
