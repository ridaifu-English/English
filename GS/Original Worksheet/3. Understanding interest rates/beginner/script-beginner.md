[0:05] Why does it cost money
[0:06] to borrow money?
[0:09] If your friend borrows some money from you,
[0:11] you wouldn't expect them to pay you back more than you lent them.
[0:15] Well, you would,
[0:16] if you were a bank.
[0:18] Lending people money is a service they provide.
[0:20] And for that service, they charge
[0:22] money.
[0:24] So it costs money
[0:26] to borrow
[0:28] money.
[0:29] That extra money
[0:30] is called interest.
[0:32] Interest is calculated as a percentage
[0:33] or a fraction
[0:35] of the loan the bank gives you.
[0:38] People borrow money to buy things
[0:40] they can't afford to pay right away.
[0:42] For example, houses.
[0:44] Houses are
[0:45] really expensive.
[0:47] Rather than waiting to save the whole amount,
[0:50] a person can borrow from the bank to buy it
[0:52] and live in the house
[0:53] while they pay off the loan.
[0:55] But it comes
[0:56] at a price.
[0:58] Say a couple needs to borrow
[1:00] 100 thousand dollars to buy a house
[1:02] at an interest rate of 4%.
[1:04] Part of each payment they make
[1:06] is an interest charge collected by the bank.
[1:09] By the time the loan is paid off in 25 years,
[1:12] the couple will have paid $58,000 dollars in interest

[1:16] on top of the original $100,000 dollars they borrowed.
[1:21] That's the cost of borrowing money.
