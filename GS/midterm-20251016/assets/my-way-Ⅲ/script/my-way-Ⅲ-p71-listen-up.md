Male: Do you know Miura Ori?
Female: Not really. Is it a way of origami or something?

Female: Oh, I saw that on TV. I was surprised to see that such a huge panel was folded into a small size.
Male: Right. Miura Ori is a way of folding paper in one motion.
Female: Wow, just in one motion?
Male: Yes. And it's also useful for folding a map because it's easy to open and close.
